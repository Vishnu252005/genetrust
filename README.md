## üöß The Journey & Challenges

Building GeneTrust+ was not just about writing code‚Äîit was a true adventure in cloud, AI, and teamwork. We faced our share of tough moments:

- **Cloud Integration Hurdles:** Setting up secure, real-time connections between Flutter, Firebase, and Gemini AI was a challenge. We wrestled with API limits, authentication quirks, and the ever-changing landscape of cloud services. Debugging cross-platform issues and ensuring data privacy required patience and creativity.
- **AI & UX Balance:** Making advanced AI feel friendly, safe, and accessible for all users took many iterations. We worked hard to ensure every answer was clear, helpful, and always included the right disclaimers.
- **Teamwork & Learning:** We learned to communicate, adapt, and support each other‚Äîespecially when things broke at the worst possible time!

But every late-night bug, every cloud error, and every "aha!" moment made us stronger. We're proud to have built a platform that empowers users to understand their health, ask questions, and get instant, trustworthy answers‚Äîanytime, anywhere.

**GeneTrust+ is more than an app. It's a mission to make healthcare knowledge accessible, safe, and human.**
